## The Mission

BcnEng is a non-profit organization whose mission is to let Barcelona's tech hub become one of the best tech communities around the globe.

- Foment training among the community

We will do that keeping our values:

- Transparency
- Community-driven
- Diversity
- Open-source

## The History

BcnEng's Slack started as a solution for a communication problem between two
ex-colleagues ([Sergio Moya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smoya) and [Gonzalo
Serrano](https://gon.cat)) that worked in the same team in a Barcelona startup for
years but parted ways for new jobs in November 2016. They wanted to keep
being in touch as a group and found Slack was the solution.

Months passed, and the community kept growing slowly but steadily, till today, with
more than 11K registered users and around 1.5K weekly active users.

## The team

#### The staff

Luckily, more people organically joined the community to help organize and
ensure everything ran smoothly. Here is the staff team:
