# Channels

You can propose improvements to this document by communicating them in the
`#ask-staff` channel or [opening a pull
request](https://github.com/bcneng/website/blob/master/content/channels.md).

## Introduction

With around 10.000 members, channels are essential for structuring content.

We expect from the members of the community to write their messages in the
appropiate channel, and the staff team and other community champions will help
in that regard.

Read our [netiquette](/netiquette) to learn which content is not allowed.

As a rule of thumb, the more specific the channel the better. So please,
before posting in `#offtopic-random`, look twice for another channel. If you
miss a channel, suggest one at `#ask-staff`.

In the following index you can find the channel that suits your needs.

Some of them are tagged with the following tags:
- `read-only`: only the admins can create new posts in the channel. Answers are open.
- `candebot-only`: only content created via our beloved Candebot can be posted. Answers are open.
- `anonymous-enabled`: the [Open Say bot](https://opensay.co/) is enabled in 
the channel so you can ask and answer anonymously.
