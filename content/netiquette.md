## Definition

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology#Netiquette):

> Netiquette [...] is a set of social conventions that facilitate interaction over networks [...]

## Conventions

Here you will find a set of basic conventions that we find useful. They are part of the set of behaviours that the community users expect from each other. Please make sure you understand all of them. Remember that you can write any question or ask for advice in our specific Slack channel #coc-netiquette

### Behaviour

Be respectful with your colleagues and follow the [Code of Conduct](/coc/) rules.

### Accounts

As a people-first slack organization, company accounts are not allowed.

### Content

#### Best practices

- Be specific when selecting in which channel to post, following our [channel guidelines](/channels)
- Use threads when possible to keep the conversations organized. Don't send your replies to the channel unless there is a change of topic in the thread.
- Pasting a random link sometimes does not add much value. Consider explaining why you did it.
- Consider removing the link previews.
- Use [reactions](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/202931348-Use-emoji-and-reactions) to give a quick feedback. Writing _haha_, _jaja_, _XDDD_ or _lol_ does not contribute much.
- Avoid sending the same message to multiple channels, also known as [crossposting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossposting). We like keeping things tidy.

#### Bad practices

Spam is not allowed in any channel. That includes:

- Affiliates links
- Job offers outside #hiring-job-board
- Posting lots of messages (for our own definition of "lots")
- Company advertising -- only fully open source initiatives are allowed, we don't want to be a platform for private companies to make money 

The administrators reserve the rights to:
- Remove abusive and/or spam comments
- Remove link previews for readability's sake

The publisher will be contacted in any case.

#### Hiring inquiries

If you are recruiting, you are not allowed to contact any member of this community, 
unless:

- They have contacted you first, or
- They have posted in some channel that they are explicitly looking for a job

The best way to get leads is to post a job offer at the #hiring-job-board channel and wait for people to contact you.

If you provide recruiting services, you are not allowed to contact any member of this community that has posted a job offer, unless:

- They have contacted you first, or
- They have posted in some channel that they are explicitly looking for recruiting services

In any other case, we will consider it spam and you will be banned.
