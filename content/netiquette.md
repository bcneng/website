# BcnEng's slack netiquette

Welcome to BcnEng's slack netiquette. If you do not agree with some guideline or wish to propose an improvement, feel free to open a pull request.

## Definition

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology#Netiquette):

> Netiquette [...] is a set of social conventions that facilitate interaction over networks [...]

## Conventions

Here you will find a set of basic conventions that we find useful. They are part of the set of behaviours that the community users expect from each other. Please make sure you understand all of them. Remember that you can write any question or ask for advice in our specific Slack channel #coc-netiquette

### Behaviour

Be respectful with your colleagues and follow the [Code of Conduct](/coc/) rules.

### Accounts

As a people-first slack organization, company accounts are not allowed.

### Content

#### Best practices

- Use threads when possible to keep the conversations organized.
- Pasting a random link sometimes does not add much value. Consider explaining why you did it.
- Consider removing the link previews.
- Use [reactions](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/202931348-Use-emoji-and-reactions) to give a quick feedback. Writing _haha_, _jaja_, _XDDD_ or _lol_ does not contribute much.

#### Bad practices

Spam is not allowed in any channel. That includes:

- Affiliates links
- Job offers outside #hiring-job-board
- Any non-general information in #offtopic-random
- Posting lots of messages (for our own definition of "lots")
- Company advertising -- we don't want to be a platform for private companies to make money 

The administrators reserve the rights to:
- Remove abusive and/or spam comments
- Remove link previews for readability's sake

The publisher will be contacted in any case.

#### Hiring inquiries

If you work for a recruitment company, you are not allowed to contact members of this community 
unless they have contacted you first. We consider it spam. The best way to get leads is to post 
a job offer at the #hiring-job-board channel and wait for people to contact you.

### Channels

Default channels are three:

- #welcome: please introduce yourself here.
- #general: for staff team messages to the community.
- #offtopic-random: anything that does not fit in other channels.

Please prefer a specific channel over offtopic-random.

Ask in #ask-staff before creating a new channel. Sometimes it was already created and archived because it didn't have enough traffic.

Read the channel topic for some guidelines in specific channels. Here are some examples:

- #show-and-tell: tell us about your side projects, new blog posts...
- #lang-xyz: programming languages channels.
- #hiring-job-board: post job offers using the workflow specified in the topic.
- #hiring-discussions: conversations around hiring.
- #ask-staff: share your concerns, ask the staff team and suggest changes. Discuss our [Code of Conduct](/coc/) and [Netiquette](#bcnengs-slack-netiquette)'s contents.
- #offtopic-cryparty: share with others that thing that makes you angry.
- #offtopic-feeling-good: share with others that thing that makes you happy.
