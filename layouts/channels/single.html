				With around 10.000 members, channels are essential for structuring content.
				</p>

				<p>
				We expect from the members of the community to write their messages in the
				appropiate channel, and the staff team and other community champions will help
				in that regard.
				</p>

				<p>
				Read our <a href="/netiquette">netiquette</a> to learn which content is not allowed.
				</p>

				<p>
				As a rule of thumb, the more specific the channel the better. So please,
				before posting in <span class="channel_name">#offtopic-random</span>, look twice for another channel.
				</p>

				<p>
				Note: you can propose improvements to this document by communicating them in the
				<span class="channel_name">#ask-staff</span> channel or <a href="https://github.com/bcneng/website/blob/master/data/channels.json">opening a pull request</a>
